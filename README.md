# Real-time scheduling simulator for embedded systems #

Real-time scheduling simulator for embedded systems.

Goal: compute the basic properties of a task set and create a schedule using
the rate monotonic (RM), earliest deadline first (EDF) and least laxity first
(LLF) algorithms.  Use simple, idealised systems, since students must be able
to schedule them manually.  Create data and nice graphs for lecture notes and
exams.
